I started blogging way back in 2008 when I created my first blog [SevenSeconds](http://sevenseconds.wordpress.com). Since then I have written a little over 200 posts, some long and some short. Nearly all of my posts were written in the context of my life at Blackboard running a Performance Engineering team, building a Security organization and growing a global development organization. 

As I wrote in my [last post](https://sevenseconds.wordpress.com/2015/04/27/seven-months-into-startup-life-tell-me-again-why-i-havent-been-blogging-about-it/), I've moved back into the world of startup life. Now instead of building an organization and being relegated to pushing spreadsheets, I get hands-on again. I'm doing meaningful engineering work for the first time in years. That is challenging my mind and my spirit in ways that I hadn't seen in years.

I'm not sure if this 8th or 9th attempt at getting back on the blog waggon is going to be a failed attempt or successful. I'm going to do it nonetheless. For now, I'm going to do it here using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). I will still keep my old blog around. I might even post from time to time. I'm hoping for this to be my blog of shorts...blog entries less than a page or simple idea.
