You probably noticed some changes to my blog today. I've added a background file I used years ago in a presentation I gave at Blackboard World. It's been years since I mucked around with CSS and I was trying to get comfortable with it. I didn't really do much. I simply added the background, rotated it and then made sure to avoid repeating the image as the blog entry requires scrolling. 

I made some tweaks to font colors as well. I'm not a front-end developer whatsoever, but I really want to teach my daughters how to design their web sites with more power and control. I equate this teaching myself Calculus or Algebra again when my daughters go to middle and high school. I need to be prepared if you catch my drift.
