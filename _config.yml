  My name is Steve Feldman. You may or may not know me. Somehow you stumbled across my blog because most likely I didnâ€™t tell you it exists. I am married to a beautiful woman named Jenny. I have two adventurous and fearless daughters named Caroline and Molly. After 11 crazy and fun years @Blackboard, I've been fortunate to head up Engineering at Contrast Security.
